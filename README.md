# project_code
This project is the code for the final project, and it includes two parts, one is the classification of clothes and the other is the object detection for the detail of clothes which we are classified.
The method we use for classification is densenet,through comparing with other methods like inception v3,resnet and so on. We find the densenet got the best result, the acurate ate can achieve to 88%, which is so high for us.Of course,We still have a long way to go.
The method we use for object detection is yolo3, through comparing with faster-rcnn and rcnn, we found that yolo3 was the most  effective.
